The above files contain:

The groups initial Unity project for testing Oculus Rift device. The test screen
only contains two cubes but it works for display and head tracking. 

The other folders contain the plugin used for wrapping the output from the Novint Falcon
and sending it to Unity. In order for the falcon to work properly the server must be run first,
this is due to the fact the Unity was the free version. Pro would be required to do a simple plugin import.


Currently, the only item that has not been met is the ability to grab objects.
